## Project Overview

The **Restaurant Booking System** is a Django application designed to manage table reservations for a restaurant. It allows users to view existing reservations and make new reservations via a RESTful API. The application is structured with models, views, and serializers to handle data efficiently.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Django**: 5.1.2
- **Django REST Framework**: 3.15.2
- **PostgreSQL**: or another database of your choice
- **Other dependencies**: Listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/booking.git
   cd booking
2. pip install -r requirements.txt

### Configuration
1. Environment Variables:

* Create a .env file in the root of your project and set the following variables:

2.Database Configuration:

* The project uses dj-database-url to configure the database. Ensure your DATABASE_URL variable points to your PostgreSQL database, such as:
  * DATABASE_URL=postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/NAME

3. Allowed Hosts:

* Modify the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting in settings.py to include your server's domain or IP, e.g.:
  python

  * ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['8000-getaneht-bookingsystemb-ln7tky9hm33.ws.codeinstitute- 
 ide.net','*.heroku.com','restaurant-booking-app-332799487776.herokuapp.com']

4. CORS Configuration:

 * The application allows all origins for development. For production, you should specify allowed origins in settings.py:
    python
   
*CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ['8000-getaneht-bookingsystemb-ln7tky9hm33.ws.codeinstitute- 
  ide.net','*.heroku.com','restaurant-booking-app-332799487776.herokuapp.com']


### Running the Application
1. Apply migrations:

* python manage.py migrate
* Create a superuser :


* Copy code
* python manage.py createsuperuser
